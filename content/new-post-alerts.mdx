At some point, I'll probably write about content that is heavily biased. I already have a few ideas for things that I have done no research on.
For posts like these where the quality of the truthfulness might be low, I'll add "bubbles" into the articles.

## Analysis-Only Bubble
For example, whenever the post is controversial, I insert this:

<AnalysisOnlyBubble />

This alert reminded me of an iconic phrase stated by a famous greek philospher.

<Quote author="Aristotle">It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.</Quote>

The point is, I like to explore highly radical ideas, including those that are not taken very well by most people today.
I hope this will reassure you (readers) that I myself do not necessarily support them; I write about it only because they are quite interesting.

## Biased Bubble
Opinionated articles will be headed with:

<BiasedBubble />

I'll only use this whenever I assert something is somehow greater in some attribute than something else without justifying it.

## Original-Only Bubble
It takes time to properly fact-check everything I state, and I intend this "blog" to be for only free-style thought with little to no editing involved.
Whenever I write about something with potentially false information, I'll insert this:

<OriginalOnlyBubble />

However, the lack of this alert does not necessarily guarantee that everything is true, so be sure to use your own judgement.
