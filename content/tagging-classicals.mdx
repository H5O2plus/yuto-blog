Most music files come with tags (metadata info) to help music players organize music.

For example, the song ["Gucci Gang" by Lil Pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gucci_Gang) might be tagged (not respecting any real standard):
```
TITLE: Gucci Gang
ARTIST: Lil Pump
ALBUM: Lil Pump
YEAR: 2017
COMMENT:
GENRE: Hip hop; Trap
```
There are a few standards for this, and although there are fields to support classical music, in practice, most music players don't bother with fields such as `COMPOSER`, `PERFORMER`, `CONDUCTOR`, `ORCHESTRA`, `KEY`, and so on.

To solve this problem of organizing music, there are 2 solutions.
1. Use the popular fields instead, repurposing them appropriately.
    * So put the composer in `ARTIST`, work name in `ALBUM`, movement/section in `TITLE`, etc.
2. Use/Create a music player that actually supports classical fields

I personally went with the former since I wanted to use popular fully-fledged music players.

So how do I tag in practice? Here is my formatting:
* `TITLE`
    * Unique to each file
    * If the track is part of a larger work (e.g. movement, section, piece, etc.):
        * `[work name], [mvmt]( - [nickname])`
    * If the track is a singular piece:
        * `[piece name]`
    * If the track is an excerpt from a larger work:
        * `[excerpt name] from [work name]`
    * The `[mvmt]` field takes the following forms:
        * `Mvmt. [#]` for movements
        * `Sec. [#]` for sections
        * `Pt. [#]` for parts
        * `Tab. [#]` for parts but in French (Tableau)
        * `[#]` for pieces
        * `Act [#] Scene [#]` for operas
        * `Pt. [#] Ep. [#]` for certain ballets
            * `Ep.` = Episode
    * For recordings where movements/sections are split across multiple tracks, use:
        * `Sec. 1 Pt. 1`, `Sec. 1 Pt. 2`, etc.
    * E.g.
        * `Symphony No. 1, Mvt. 1 – Allegro`
        * `Arabesque No. 1`
        * `Ma mère l'Oye, Mvt. 2 - Tableau I: Danse du rouet et scène - Interlude`
* `ARTIST`
    * `[composer last name]`
* `ALBUM`
    * Represents a work or a singular piece
    * `[work/group name]( in [key])(, [opus # or equivalent])( - [nickname])`
    * E.g.
        * `Symphony No. 5 in D minor, Op. 107 – Reformation`
        * `Deux arabesques, L. 66`
        * `Syrinx, L. 129`
        * `Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550`
        * `Ma mère l'Oye, M. 62 - Mother Goose`
* `ALBUM ARTIST`
    * If the work is played by an orchestra:
        * `[orchestra name]`
    * If the work is played by a soloist:
        * `[soloist name]`
* Filename
    * `%ARTIST% %TITLE%`
